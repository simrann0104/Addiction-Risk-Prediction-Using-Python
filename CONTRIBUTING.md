## Getting Started

Before contributing, please:

1. Read through the project README to understand the project goals
2. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
3. Familiarize yourself with the codebase structure

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AddictionRiskPredictionUsingPythonmain
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

3. Verify installation by running the notebook or scripts

### Running the Streamlit App (Local demo)

1. Ensure dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This launches a local interactive demo at http://localhost:8501 by default. The app uses a saved model file `random_forest_model.pkl` (place this in the project root) and will optionally compute SHAP explanations if a background dataset is available (e.g., `balanced_dataset.csv` or `Cleaned_Dataset_Encoded.xlsx`).

### Running SHAP Analysis Script

There is a helper script that generates SHAP plots and outputs in `scripts/add_shap_analysis.py`.

1. Make sure the trained model `random_forest_model.pkl` and the dataset `Cleaned_Dataset_Encoded.xlsx` are in the project root.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python scripts/add_shap_analysis.py
```

This will create PNGs and a CSV with SHAP feature importance values.

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues in existing code
- **Feature additions**: Add new functionality (e.g., new models, visualizations)
- **Documentation**: Improve README, add comments, create tutorials
- **Data preprocessing**: Enhance data cleaning and feature engineering
- **Model improvements**: Optimize hyperparameters, try new algorithms
- **Testing**: Add unit tests or validation scripts

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   \`\`\`
3. **Make your changes** following our code standards
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Commit your changes** with clear messages:
   \`\`\`bash
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your changes"
   \`\`\`
6. **Push to your fork**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   \`\`\`
7. **Submit a Pull Request** with a detailed description

## Code Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Example:

\`\`\`python
def calculate_risk_score(features: pd.DataFrame) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculate addiction risk scores for given features.
    
    Args:
        features: DataFrame containing feature values
        
    Returns:
        Array of risk scores
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
\`\`\`

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Clear markdown explanations before code cells
- Remove unnecessary output before committing
- Use descriptive cell titles
- Keep cells focused on single tasks

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Include usage examples for new functions
- Document data requirements and formats

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

Your pull request should:

1. **Have a clear title** describing the change
2. **Include a detailed description** explaining:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were necessary
   - How to test the changes
3. **Reference related issues** (e.g., "Fixes #123")
4. **Include screenshots** for UI/visualization changes
5. **Pass all tests** (if applicable)
